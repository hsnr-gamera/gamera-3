===================================
Getting started with Gamera scripts
===================================

Overview
--------

While the GUI is great for experimentation, the ultimate goal of any
Gamera application is usually an automated application, or script.
This provides, among other things, the ability to run unattended in
batch mode.

Gamera scripts are merely Python scripts (modules) that use Gamera
objects and call Gamera functions.  The Python language, being a
feature-rich general purpose language, provides a number of ways to
structure your application.  The high-level structure of your
application will largely depend on its size and complexity and your
own programming preferences and style, and is out of the scope of this
document.  Obtaining some level of familiarity with Python through the
`Python Tutorial`_ or any of the numerous `Python books`__ available is
recommended.

The examples below demonstrate how to start creating Gamera-based
applications.  The source code of these examples are available in the
examples directory of the Gamera distribution.  Each example builds on
the previous one.

Hello, world!
-------------

To use Gamera in a Python script, you simply need to import the
``gamera.core`` module and then initialize it:

.. code:: Python

   from gamera.core import *
   init_gamera()

After that, you can use Gamera's functions and methods.  The following
code loads a given file specified on the command line, converts it to
a one-bit (binary) image, and then saves the result to "output.png".

.. code:: Python

   import sys

   # Import the Gamera core and initialize it
   from gamera.core import *
   init_gamera()

   # Load filename specified on the command line.
   # load_image is a Gamera function to load a TIFF or PNG file.
   # sys.argv is the Pythonic way to access commandline arguments.
   # (A better way to deal with commandline arguments in Python
   # is the optparse module, but that's too much detail for this
   # example...)
   image = load_image(sys.argv[-1])

   # The variable 'image' now is a reference to the image

   # Convert the image to onebit using the default Otsu method
   onebit = image.to_onebit()

   # Save the result to a PNG file
   onebit.save_PNG("output.png")

That's about as simple as it gets with Gamera, but clearly only about
as useful as the ubiquitous "Hello, World!" you see in programming texts.

Using the GUI from your scripts
-------------------------------

For interactive use, it may be desirable to have the results of a
script displayed in a window, rather than saved to a file.  (If you do
not wish to do this, you can safely skip this section.)  This image
window will have all of the panning and zooming functionality of the
regular Gamera image window, but it will not be possible to use the
right-click menu to perform further updates to the image.

Using the GUI for a script is convenient, though slightly tricky for
two reasons:

1. Any code that displays images or otherwise interacts with the GUI
   must run inside the GUI thread.  The simplest way to do this is to
   do all work inside of a function, and then pass this function
   as an argument to ``gui.run()``.  This will have the GUI start the
   application once it has been initialized.

2. One must be careful about the lifetime of image objects.  Since Python
   uses reference counting for memory management, whenever there are
   no longer any references pointing to an image object, it is
   automatically deleted.  Whenever an
   image object is deleted, the window is destroyed as well.  So to
   keep windows open for viewing after processing is
   finished, there needs to be at least one reference remaining.  The
   simplest way to do this is to assign the image to a global variable.

The following is the same as the previous example, except rather than
saving the result to disk, it is displayed in a Gamera display window.

.. code:: Python

   import sys

   def my_application():
      # Make the image variable a global variable
      # IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, THE WINDOW WILL DISAPPEAR!
      global image

      # Load the image
      image = load_image(sys.argv[-1])

      # Display the image in a window
      image.display()

   # Import the Gamera core and initialize it
   from gamera.core import *
   init_gamera()

   # Import the Gamera GUI and start it
   from gamera.gui import gui
   gui.run(my_application)

   # The GUI thread will automatically stop when all windows have
   # been closed.
   print "Goodbye!"

Using the classifier
--------------------

One of Gamera's core features is the classifier, which allows
individual images to be classified based on some training.  The
classifier is described in detail in `the classifier documentation`__.

.. __: classify.html

The following is an example that loads an image and classifies its
connected components based on a given training set.  Some training
data for what is expected in the image is required in order for this
example to work correctly.

.. code:: Python

   import sys

   def my_application():
      global ccs

      # Load the image, and convert it to onebit
      image = load_image(sys.argv[-1])
      onebit = image.to_onebit()

      # Get the connected components from the image
      ccs = onebit.cc_analysis()

      # Classify the cc's
      classifier.classify_list_automatic(ccs)

      # Display the ccs to show their classification
      display_multi(ccs)

   # Import the Gamera core and initialize it
   from gamera.core import *
   init_gamera()

   # Import the classifier module
   from gamera import knn
   # Create a new classifier
   classifier = knn.kNNInteractive()
   # Load some training data
   classifier.from_xml_filename("training.xml")

   # Import the Gamera GUI and start it
   from gamera.gui import gui
   gui.run(my_application)

Advanced use of the classifier
------------------------------

There are a couple of downsides to using the classifier as described
in the previous section:

- The classifier may not be as accurate as possible

- Loading the XML file everytime the script starts up can be time
  consuming.

If one is willing to give up the ability to add more elements to the
training set at runtime, both of these problems can be ameliorated.

Once you have the serialized version of the classifier, it can be
loaded easily from your production script:

.. code:: Python

   from gamera.core import *
   init_gamera()

   from gamera import knn

   # Load the classifier from the binary format
   classifier = knn.kNNNonInteractive("training.knn")

   # Then, we can use the classifier as we otherwise would...

   # Load the image, and convert it to onebit
   image = load_image(sys.argv[-1])
   onebit = image.to_onebit()

   # Get the connected components from the image
   ccs = onebit.cc_analysis()

   # Classify the cc's
   classifier.classify_list_automatic(ccs)

   ...

Dealing with command line options
---------------------------------

Third party scripts are free to deal with command line arguments as
they wish.  For instance, the Python standard library has two modules
for parsing command line arguments, ``getopt`` (deprecated) and
``optparse``.

Of course, this freedom means that Gamera will ignore its own command
line arguments when run from scripts.  There are two ways to deal with
this problem:

  1. explicitly tell Gamera to parse the command line arguments

  2. programmatically set Gamera options

Having Gamera parse the command line
````````````````````````````````````

Generally, if your script would rather ignore the command line and
pass all command line arguments verbatim to Gamera, simply do the
following near the top of the script, but *after* importing Gamera:

.. code:: Python

  from gamera.core import *
  import sys
  from gamera.config import config
  config.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])

Alternatively, you can send "fake" command line arguments for Gamera
to parse:

.. code:: Python

  from gamera.core import *
  from gamera.config import config
  config.parse_args(["--progress-bar"])

Programmatically setting options
````````````````````````````````

Gamera also provides an API to set its options that normally would
come from the command line.  Simply use the ``set`` method on the
``config`` object.

For example,

.. code:: Python

  from gamera.config import config
  config.set("progress_bar", True)

is directly equivalent to the following command line::

  gamera_gui --progress-bar

Note that the name of the command line argument is changed to be a
valid Python identifier name when used with the ``.set`` method: the
hypens (``-``) have been replaced by underscores (``_``).  This is the
standard behavior of ``optparse``, the command line parsing module
that Gamera uses.

Where to go from here
---------------------

Obviously, there's a lot more to Gamera that isn't covered in this
chapter.  Where you go from here is largely dependant on the
particular document domain.  Most of the work in many Gamera
applications involves analysing the positional information, symbolic
classification and features of the connected components to recognize
structure and semantics of the image.

A good example of how to put these things together is in
``roman_text.py``, which puts simple left-to-right, top-to-bottom
printed text into its reading order.
