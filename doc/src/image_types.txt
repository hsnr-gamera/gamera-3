Image types
===========

There are a number of different image types in Gamera that serve
different purposes.  Fortunately, they all share a common interface,
which allows many operations on images to be compiled for different
image types from the same source code using C++ templates.  This is
why *all* Gamera plugin methods are templatized (see `Writing Gamera
Plugins`__).

Image types are specified on two axes: 1] the type of pixels the
contain, and 2] the storage type:

Pixel types
===========

The pixels in an image can be one of the following types:

   ``RGB``
	24-bit color pixels (8-bits per pixel),
	representing 2 ^ 24 (16,777,216) different colors.

   ``GREYSCALE``
        8-bit greyscale, representing 256 different levels
        of grey.

   ``GREY16``
        16-bit greyscale, representing 65,536 different levels of
        grey.

   ``ONEBIT``
	For black-and-white images.  The underlying representation is
	actually 16 bits-per-pixel, since `connected component
	labelling`__ stores information with each pixel.  This seems
	like wasted space, but since connected component labelling is
	so common in Gamera, it more often is a space savings from the
	fact that the image data can be "shared."

   ``FLOAT``
        32-bit floating point greyscale.  This is useful for images
        that need a really wide dynamic range.

   .. warning:: Unfortunately, at this time ``FLOAT`` images can not be saved
      or loaded.

   .. note:: When ``FLOAT`` images are displayed in the GUI, the output is automatically
      "normalized" so that the total range in the image is equal to the
      range of brightnesses your monitor can display.

Storage types
=============

Gamera has two ways of storing the image data in memory behind the scenes:

   ``DENSE``
	Uncompressed.  The image data is a contiguous chunk of memory
	that is addressed in row-major order (left-to-right,
	top-to-bottom).

   ``RLE``
	Run-length encoded.  For certain kinds of images,
	run-length-encoding can be a performance improvement since
	less data needs to be transferred between main memory and the
	CPU.

.. warning:: At present, ``RLE`` is only available for ``ONEBIT`` images.

.. note:: Any performance improvement should be justified only
   by profiling on real-world data
