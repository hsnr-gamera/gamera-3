Writing Gamera Plugins
=============================

Introduction
============

The functionality of Gamera can be extended by writing plugins in
either C++ or Python.  A plugin is simply a set of methods (which are
automagically added to the ``Image`` class) or free-standing functions.
Plugins are technially just Python modules, but with more 
information that allows for easier wrapping and compilation of C++ methods
and to support all kinds of automatic things in the graphical user interface.

Plugins can also be grouped together, with other tools, into toolkits.
Toolkits provide higher-level workflow framework for end-to-end document
recognition by joining together a number of steps from various
plugins.  Toolkits are a whole other discussion, so see the
`writing Gamera toolkits`__ for more information.

.. __: writing_toolkits.html

Before writing any plugin, you should make sure there isn't already a
plugin included that does what you want.  Look at the `list of plugins included with Gamera`__.

.. __: plugins.html

The files involved
------------------

You first need to decide whether your plugin will reside in the Gamera
core or in an external toolkit.  See `Writing toolkits`__ for more
information about creating a Gamera toolkit.

.. __: writing_toolkits.html

Each plugin is made up of two files: 

1. A Python file that describes each method in the plugin and the
   plugin itself.  If any methods are "pure Python", they can also be
   defined here, or they can just delegate to functions in other
   Python modules.

2. Optionally, a C++ header file containing implementations of any C++
   methods of the plugin.  This is a header file (``.hpp``) and not an
   implementation file (``.cpp``) because the code you write will be templatized
   and the concrete methods and the glue code connecting to Python to
   C++ will be generated automatically at compile time by the Gamera
   build system.  (What templates are is beyond the scope of this
   document, but it's covered very well in [Stroustrup1997]_.)

Plugins in the Gamera source tree
`````````````````````````````````
The Python metadata files are stored in ``./gamera/plugins/`` and the
C++ source files are stored in ``./include/plugins``.

If you keep these files in the proper directories, they will be
automatically picked up by the build system and compiled.  When Gamera
is started up, it will search the ``./gamera/plugins`` directory and load
all plugins.

Plugins in a toolkit
````````````````````

In a toolkit, the Python metadata files are stored in
``./gamera/toolkits/my_toolkit/plugins/`` and the C++ source files are
stored in ``./include/plugins``, both rooted at the top of your
toolkit directory.

Plugin modules included in toolkits will have to be explicitly
imported before they are available.

A simple example
================

Plugin metadata
---------------

Let's look at a simple metadata file, ``example.py``.  Each method is
described by creating a class that inherits from
``gamera.plugin.PluginFunction`` and defining a number of special
members.  The whole plugin is described by a class that inherits from
``gamera.plugin.PluginModule``:

.. code:: Python

  from gamera.plugin import *
  import _example

  # C++ method
  class volume(PluginFunction):
      """Returns the ratio of black pixels to white pixels within the
      bounding box of the image."""
      self_type = ImageType([ONEBIT])
      return_type = FloatVector("volume", 1)
      doc_examples = [(ONEBIT,)]

  class ExampleModule(PluginModule):
      category = "Example"
      cpp_headers=["example.hpp"]
      functions = [volume]
      author = "Michael Droettboom and Karl MacMillan"
      url = "http://gamera.dkc.jhu.edu/"
  module = ExampleModule()

Okay, now let's break it down.

The ``gamera.plugin`` module contains all of the utilities necessary to
create Gamera plugins, so the first thing we do is import it:

.. code:: Python

  from gamera.plugin import *

Next, we import the C++ side of the plugin, (described in the next
section) which *always* has the same name as the Python metadata
module, except with a leading underscore:

.. code:: Python

  import _example

Let's start by describing a minimal C++ method.  All methods and
functions in a plugin are described using a class that inherits from
``gamera.plugin.PluginFunction``:

.. code:: Python

  # C++ method
  class volume(PluginFunction):

Each plugin can (and should) be documented in the usual `Python
docstring`__ way:

.. code:: Python

      """Returns the ratio of black pixels to white pixels within the
      bounding box of the image."""

.. __: http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/node6.html

On a related note, you can also have the documentation system
(``doc/gendoc.py``) generate an example automatically.  The
``doc_examples`` member is a list of tuples, each of which is a set of
arguments to pass to the plugin method.  If the first argument in the
tuple is a pixel type constant (e.g. ``ONEBIT``), a generic image will
be loaded from disk and used as ``self`` to generate the example.  If the
result of the method is an image, the image will be included in the
HTML documentation.  If the result is not an image, a text
representation of the result (obtained using the standard Python
``repr()``) will be included.  (Look at the generated `Plugin
documentation`__ for many examples of this.):

.. code:: Python

      doc_examples = [(ONEBIT,)]

.. __: plugins.html

Next, we define ``self_type``, which is the type of object this
method can be called on.  If ``self_type`` is an ``ImageType``, the method
will automatically be added to all ``Image`` objects in Gamera whenever
the plugin is imported.  Within the ``ImageType`` specifier, you can
choose which types of pixels are supported using a list of pixel type
names. Valid options are ``ONEBIT``, ``GREYSCALE``, ``GREY16``, ``FLOAT`` and ``RGB``
(these are all constants imported from the ``gamera.plugin module``):

.. code:: Python

      self_type = ImageType([ONEBIT])

You can also optionally define ``return_type``.  This specifier is used to generate
a variable name for the result in the GUI, and so the C++ wrapping
machanism knows how to return the result to Python.  If you don't specify a
return type, Gamera assumes there is no return result:

.. code:: Python

      return_type = FloatVector("volume", 1)

Obviously, this is a very simple plugin method with no arguments.  Some more
involved examples are given below.  In the meantime, let's look at how
this method is contained in a plugin module.

For each plugin module, you also need a class to describe the entire
plugin.  There may be *only one* of these classes per plugin.  This is
done in a similar manner to how the methods are described.

There is a class that inherits from ``gamera.plugin.PluginModule``:

.. code:: Python

  class ExampleModule(PluginModule):

You can specify a category for the plugin's methods on
the context (right-click) menu in the GUI:

.. code:: Python

    category = "Example"

If you have any C++ methods (which we do in this case), you must
specify the C++ header files to include which contain the
corresponding method's source code:

.. code:: Python

    cpp_headers=["example.hpp"]

You must also list all of the plugins and methods in the file so they
can be generated and loaded:

.. code:: Python

    functions = [volume]

Optionally, the author names and a URL for more information can be
specified:

.. code:: Python

    author = "Michael Droettboom and Karl MacMillan"
    url = "http://dkc.jhu.edu/gamera/"

Lastly, we create an instance of this class so the module loader can do its work:

.. code:: Python

  module = ExampleModule()

C++ code
----------

Since the ``volume`` method needs to look at individual pixels, it
is likely going to be much faster written in C++ than in Python.  Below is
the corresponding ``example.hpp`` that contains the C++
implementation:

.. code:: CPP

  #include "gamera.hpp"

  using namespace Gamera;

  template<class T>
  float volume(const T &m) {
    unsigned int count = 0;
    typename T::const_vec_iterator i = m.vec_begin();
    for (; i != m.vec_end(); i++)
      if (is_black(*i))
        count++;
    return (feature_t(count) / (m.nrows() * m.ncols()));
  }

Most of the declarations needed for Gamera are in ``gamera.hpp``, and
all of that stuff is in the ``Gamera`` namespace, to prevent name
collisions.  You may find it most convenient to just put ``using
namespace Gamera`` at the top of your plugin file, rather than
specifying ``Gamera::...`` everywhere:

.. code:: CPP

  #include "gamera.hpp"
 
  using namespace Gamera;

Next we get to the function itself.  Note that it is templatized.
Since it is our goal to write a single algorithm that may work on
multiple image types, *all* plugin methods are templatized, and the
instantiations of these templates are generated by the Gamera build
system at compile-time based on the ``self_type`` specifier in the
method metadata class (that we specified in ``example.py``).  See how the first argument
``self`` is templatized as ``T`` so that any (image) type can be passed
in.  The body of the function used the `Gamera C++ Image API`__ to access
and examine the individual pixels:

.. code:: CPP

    template<class T>
    float volume(const T &m) {
      unsigned int count = 0;
      typename T::const_vec_iterator i = m.vec_begin();
      for (; i != m.vec_end(); i++)
        if (is_black(*i))
          count++;
      return (feature_t(count) / (m.nrows() * m.ncols()));
    }

.. __: image_api.html

Building the plugin
-------------------

Okay, so now we're done with the minimal plugin, but obviously
something more has to happen in order to access the C++ code from Python.
Fortunately, that is all done automatically by the Gamera build
system.  If the ``example.py`` is placed in the ``./gamera/plugins``
directory, the build system will automatically find it, use the
metadata to generate a *wrapper* to access ``example.hpp``, and compile
everything.  The next time Gamera is run, the plugin will
automatically be loaded.  The plugin author does not have to learn
about the intricacies of the `Python/C API`__.

.. __: http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/api.html

But, for the sake of some sick curiosity, the 
generated code looks something like:

.. code:: CPP

  #include <string>
  #include <stdexcept>
  #include "Python.h"
  #include <list>
  #include "gameramodule.hpp"

  init_features (void)
  {
    Py_InitModule ("_features", _features_methods);
  }

  #include "features.hpp"
 
  using namespace Gamera;

  extern "C"
  {
    void init_example (void);
    static PyObject *call_volume (PyObject * self, PyObject * args);
    static PyMethodDef _features_methods[] =
      { {"volume", call_volume, METH_VARARGS} };

    static PyObject *call_volume(PyObject * self, PyObject * args)
    {
      PyObject *real_self;
      Image *real_self_image;

      FloatVector *return_value = 0;

      if (PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "O", &real_self) <= 0)
        return 0;
      if (!is_ImageObject(real_self)) {
	PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, "Object is not an image as expected!");
	return 0;
      }
      real_self_image = ((Image *) ((RectObject *) real_self)->m_x);
      image_get_fv(real_self, &real_self_image->features, &real_self_image->features_len);
      try {
      switch (get_image_combination (real_self)) {
	case ONEBITRLEIMAGEVIEW:
	  return_value = volume(*((OneBitRleImageView *) real_self_image));
	  break;
	case RLECC:
	  return_value = volume(*((RleCc *) real_self_image));
	  break;
	case CC:
	  return_value = volume(*((Cc *) real_self_image));
	  break;
	case ONEBITIMAGEVIEW:
	  return_value = volume (*((OneBitImageView *) real_self_image));
	  break;
	default:
	  PyErr_SetString (PyExc_TypeError,
			   "Image types do not match function signature.");
	  return 0;
	}
      }
      catch (std::exception & e)
      {
        PyErr_SetString (PyExc_RuntimeError, e.what());
        return 0;
      }
      PyObject *array_init = get_ArrayInit();
      if (array_init == 0)
        return 0;
      PyObject *str = PyString_FromStringAndSize((char *) (&((*return_value)[0])),
			     	  return_value->size () * sizeof (double));
      PyObject *array = PyObject_CallFunction(array_init, "sO", "d", str);
      delete return_value;
      return array;
    }
    DL_EXPORT (void) init_example (void)
    {
      Py_InitModule ("_example", _example_methods);
    }
  }

**Aren't you glad you don't have to write something like that every
time!**

Advanced features
=================

Specifying arguments
--------------------

Of course, many plugin methods will need to have arguments.  See this
``resize_copy`` method, for example:

.. code:: Python

  # C++ image method with some arguments
  class resize_copy(PluginFunction):
      """Copies and resizes an image. In addition to size the type of
      interpolation can be specified to allow tradeoffs between speed
      and quality."""
      category = "Utility/Copy"
      self_type = ImageType([ONEBIT, GREYSCALE, GREY16, FLOAT, RGB])
      args = Args([Int("nrows"), Int("ncols"),
                  Choice("Interpolation Type", ["None", "Linear", "Spline"])])
      return_type = ImageType([ONEBIT, GREYSCALE, GREY16, FLOAT, RGB])

And the corresponding C++ declaration:

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  Image* resize_copy(T& image, int nrows, int ncols, int resize_quality);

The ``args`` member variable specifies a list of the arguments that are
passable to the method (excluding the first ``self`` argument).  This
specification is used to generate wrapper code, and also to generate
dialog boxes in the GUI.  The format of these argument lists are
documented in `Specifying arguments`__.

.. __: args.html

Free functions
--------------

It doesn't always make sense to have everything be a method of
images.  For example, you may want to create a function that requires
a list of images as input.  Fortunately, you can still use the plugin
system to automate the wrapping/building process, while foregoing the
automatic inclusion in the Image class (and the right-click context
menu). It's as simple as setting ``self_type``
to ``None`` in the metadata object:

.. code:: CPP

  # C++ free function
  class union_images(PluginFunction):
      """Creates a new image by overlaying all the images in the given list."""
      self_type = None
      args = Args([ImageList('list_of_images')])
      return_type = ImageType([ONEBIT])

Pure Python methods
-------------------

Sometimes there is not much efficiency to be gained by writing the
plugin method in C++, or you want the flexibility of Python for
experimentation.  In that case you can implement the method in pure
Python.  Everything else is the same, except you add a ``__call__`` method
with the Python implementation.  It is important that this method is a
``staticmethod``, since the first ``self`` argument is going to be an ``Image``
object and not a ``PluginFunction`` object:

.. code:: Python

  # Python image method
  class area(PluginFunction):
      """Returns the aspect ratio of the bounding box of the image"""
      self_type = ImageType([ONEBIT, GREYSCALE, GREY16, FLOAT, RGB])
      return_type = Float("area", 1)
      def __call__(self):
          return float(self.ncols) / float(self.nrows)
      __call__ = staticmethod(__call__)

Free pure Python functions
--------------------------

Since the plugin modules are also just regular Python modules under
the hood, it is of course possible to just add ordinary Python
functions as well:

.. code:: Python

  # Python free function
  def filter_small_images(l):
      return [x for x in l if x.ncols > 2 and x.nrows > 2]

Feature generators: A special kind of plugin
============================================

Plugin methods that take an image as input and generate some floating
point features from it are called "feature generators".  The resulting
floating point features are used by the classifier to classify images.

For efficiency reasons, feature generator functions are implemented
slightly differently from a regular ``PluginFunction``.  Rather than
returning the features as a return value, which would require a memory
copy into the image's feature vector, feature
generators write directly to a buffer that is passed in as an
argument.

As an example, let's look at the ``nholes`` feature generator.  The
Python metadata is the same as you would expect, except the member
``feature_function`` is set to ``True``.  This will tell the build
system to treat this plugin method as a feature generator with the
different return value behavior.  The
``return_type`` must be a ``FloatVector``, where ``length`` indicates
the number of feature values that are generated.

.. code:: Python

   class nholes(PluginFunction):
       """Returns the average number of transitions from white to black in each
   row or column.
   
   The elements of the returned ``FloatVector`` are:

   0. vertical
   1. horizontal

   These features are scale invariant.
   """
       self_type = ImageType([ONEBIT])
       return_type = FloatVector(length=2)
       feature_function = True
       doc_examples = [(ONEBIT,)]

On the C++ side, the function takes two arguments: the image, and a
pointer to a floating point buffer.  Note that the return type is ``void``.

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  void nholes(T &m, feature_t* buf) {
    int vert, horiz;
    
    vert = nholes_1d(m.col_begin(), m.col_end());
    horiz = nholes_1d(m.row_begin(), m.row_end());
    
    *(buf++) = (feature_t)vert / m.ncols();
    *buf = (feature_t)horiz / m.nrows();
  }

(The C++ function ``nholes_1d`` is where all the real work gets done,
and is not important for this illustration.)  Note how the result of the
function is copied directly into the buffer.  

.. note:: It is extrememly important not to write more values to the
  buffer than is
  defined in the metadata ``return_value``.  Doing so could cause
  Python/Gamera to behave erratically or segfault.

It is also possible to write a feature generator in pure Python.

.. code:: Python

   class nholes(PluginFunction):
       self_type = ImageType([ONEBIT])
       return_type = FloatVector(length=2)
       feature_function = True
       doc_examples = [(ONEBIT,)]

   def __call__(self, index):
       buffer = self.features
       
       # Do some processing to get values...
              
       buffer[index] = result1
       buffer[index + 1] = result2  
   __call__ = staticmethod(__call__)
