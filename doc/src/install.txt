Building and installing Gamera
==============================

Microsoft Windows
=================

Installing using the Windows installer
--------------------------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

- Python 2.3.x (only the distribution from python.org has been tested)

- wxPython 2.4.x

  **You must use wxPython version 2.4.x.** 2.3.x is no longer
  supported, and 2.5.x, being an unstable branch, will not be
  supported for some time to come.  The stable branch is a
  little hidden on the wxPython website.  It can be downloaded
  here__.

.. __: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10718&package_id=10559&release_id=188259

Installation
````````````

If you downloaded the Windows installer, simply run it to
install Gamera.

.. note:: Windows is not our primary development environment, and the
   Windows installer tends to lag a version or two behind and may not
   be as thoroughly tested.  Anyone want to become the official
   Windows builder/tester?

Installing from source
----------------------

Currently, Gamera can be built using the Cygwin/MingW32/GNU toolset or 
Microsoft Visual Studio 6 or 7.

Prerequisites
`````````````

- Python 2.3.x (only the distribution from python.org has been tested)

- wxPython 2.4.x

  **You must use wxPython version 2.4.x.** 2.3.x is no longer
  supported, and 2.5.x, being an unstable branch, will not be
  supported for some time to come.  The stable branch is a

  here__.

Cygwin/Mingw32
``````````````

Use the installer from http://www.cygwin.com/ to install Cygwin,
including the ``g++`` compiler and the ``MingW32`` libraries.
Compiling Gamera against the Cygwin DLL is theoretically possible, but
not supported.  However, you can compile Gamera using ``MingW32``, which
means there will be no non-standard Windows runtime dependencies.

You must have ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later.

Python
''''''

You have two options here

Use the Cygwin version Python that is distributed with Cygwin:
   This is the easiest approach, since it behaves most like a Unix
   system.  Skip to the next section for further instructions.

Use the MSVC-built Python from python.org:
   The advantage of this approach is that you can build an installer
   that will work with the "canonical" distribution of Python.
   However, you'll have to do a few preparation steps first.

   Go to the Python/libs directory::
	
	cd [PATH_TO_PYTHON]/libs

   Find your ``pythonXX.dll`` file, where ``XX`` is the version of
   Python you have installed.  This is normally in
   ``C:\WINDOWS\system32\`` or ``C:\winnt\system32\``.

   Make a ``.def`` file from your ``pythonXX.dll``.  (You will need to
   install ``pexports.exe`` from the Cygwin installer)::

  	pexports 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\pythonXX.dll' > pythonXX.def

   Then create a static library (``libpythonXX.a``)::

	dlltool --dllname pythonXX.dll --def
                pythonXX.def --output-lib libpythonXX.a
	
   Now you should be ready to continue below.

Standard Build and Install
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
Cygwin command prompt and type::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32

If you receive the following error (only exhibited under Python 2.3),
distutils is having trouble traversing the Cygwin-based symlink from
``/bin/cc.exe`` to ``/bin/gcc.exe``.  The hacky solution to this
(until this bugfix in distutils is fixed) is to delete the symlink and
make a real copy (at the expense of a little disk space)::

  rm /bin/cc.exe
  cp /bin/gcc.exe /bin/cc.exe

If you just want to install Gamera without the ability to uninstall::

  python setup.py install

If you'd like a real Windows installer, including uninstallation
support, you have two options:

Use the Python Distutils Installer Maker::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
  dist/gamera-X.X.X-win32.exe

Or, use the (currently experimental) MSI creation support provided in 
the Gamera source tree (see MSI section).

Microsoft Visual Studio
```````````````````````

Compiling Gamera with MS Visual Studio should be considered
preliminary and non-preferred.  Particularly in light of all of the
backwardly-incompatible things in Visual Studio .NET, it is a bit of a
pain.

First and foremost, you will need to ensure that Python was compiled
with the same version of Visual Studio as you use to compile Gamera.
At the time of this writing, the "official" distribution of Python was
compiled with Visual Studio 6.  If the compilers so not match, you may
need to recompile Python, which is a daunting task beyond the scope of
this document.

Standard Build and Install
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
Microsoft Visual Studio Command Prompt (this should have been added to
the Start Menu when you installed Visual Studio).  Change to the
directory where the Gamera source is installed and type::

  python setup.py build

If you just want to install Gamera without the ability to uninstall::

  python setup.py install

If you'd like a real Windows installer, including uninstallation
support, you have two options:

Use the Python Distutils Installer Maker::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
  dist/gamera-X.X.X-win32.exe

Or, use the (currently experimental) MSI creation support provided in 
the Gamera source tree (see MSI section).

MSI (Windows Installer Package)
```````````````````````````````

If you would like to create a Windows Installer package to install
Gamera, the Gamera source tree currently includes experimental support
to do so. The most straightforward way to build the MSI is to issue the
command "bdist_msi" to setup.py after building Gamera from source.  
Successful execution of this command depends on having the latest versions 
of MakeMSI (http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~dbareis/makemsi.htm) and the 
Microsoft Platform SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate) 
installed.  For example, if you are using the MSVC compiler::

    python setup.py build bdist_msi

will create a Windows Installer package in the dist/ directory. Or if 
you have already built Gamera::

    python setup.py bdist_msi

will suffice.

If you would like to include multiple Gamera binaries in one MSI (to 
aid in delivering targeted optimized binaries, for instance), the 
appropriate tools are located in win32/msisource. Please consult 
README.txt in that directory for more details.

Running
```````

If you chose to build the installer, double-click on the Gamera icon
on your desktop to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the Gamera compiled shared
  object files.

This file can be copied anywhere (such as the Desktop or the
Start Menu) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 2.2 and 2.3 are supported.

  You will need to have the headers (but not the complete
  source) to build Gamera from source code.  Some Linux
  distributions, such as SuSE and RedHat, include these as a
  separate package (eg. ``python-dev``).

- wxPython 2.4.x

  **You must use wxPython version 2.4.x.** 2.3.x is no longer
  supported, and 2.5.x, being an unstable branch, will not be
  supported for some time to come.  The stable branch is a
  little hidden on the wxPython website.  It can be downloaded
  here__.

.. __: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10718&package_id=10559&release_id=188259

- ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later.

- libtiff 3.5.x

- libpng 1.2.x

Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
terminal and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Installing without root priviledges
-----------------------------------

If you do not have root access to your machine, you can make a local
installation of Gamera.

Make a local python module directory somewhere that you have write
priviledges (such as your home directory)::
  
  mkdir ~/python

From the Gamera build directory, install Gamera into that directory::

  python setup.py install --home=~/python

Set up an environment variables so Python can find stuff there (you
may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile file)::

  export PYTHONPATH=~/python/lib/python

Add the local Python scripts directory to your path::

  export PATH=~/python/bin:$PATH

Now you should be able to run the ``gamera_gui`` script from the
command line.

If you wish to build toolkits you will also need to include the Gamera
include directories::

  export CFLAGS=~/python/include/python2.3/gamera/

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui`` script, which should have installed to
``/usr/local/bin``.  This file can also be copied anywhere (such as
the Desktop) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the Gamera compiled shared
  object files.

Mac OS-X
========

OS-X support can be considered working but preliminary at this point.
Gamera will only run on Panther (10.3).  We do not plan to support
earlier versions.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 2.3 (the version that comes with OS-X is recommended).

- wxPython 2.4.x

  **You must use wxPython version 2.4.x.** 2.3.x is no longer
  supported, and 2.5.x, being an unstable branch, will not be
  supported for some time to come.  The stable branch is a
  little hidden on the wxPython website.  It can be downloaded
  here__.

.. __: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10718&package_id=10559&release_id=188259

  wxPython comes in two flavors for OS-X: a native Carbon-based one that
  follows the look-and-feel of OS-X, and a version built on top of
  Gtk+/X11.  The native Carbon version is currently too incomplete to be
  usable for Gamera.  Since there is no official build of the
  Gtk+/X11 version, I have made one available in the Gamera
  SourceForge Files section.

- ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later

- X11

- Optional: Matplotlib

  Matplotlib can be compiled from source or downloaded as a binary.  We
  recommend the binary which can be downloaded here__.

.. __: http://sda.iu.edu/projects.html

Standard Build and Install
----------------------------

Download and install the unoffical wxPython-Gtk-X11 distribution from
the Gamera Files section on SourceForge.

  Alternatively, you can install fink and then build the package
  wxPython-Py23, which is currently in the unstable branch, (and its
  dependencies) from source.  You will then need to use the fink
  version of Python (not the one that Apple provides) to carry out the
  instructions below.

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  

To build Gamera, open a X11 terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin priviledges)::
 
  sudo python setup.py install

The scripts can be installed by::

  sudo python setup.py install_scripts -d /usr/bin

.. note:: The ``-d /usr/bin/`` installs the scripts in a reasonable
  place on the PATH.  If you do not specify it, the scripts are by
  default installed to
  ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin``.

Running
-------

Start an X11 terminal and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.  

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the Gamera compiled shared
  object files.
