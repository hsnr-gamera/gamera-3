==============================
Building and installing Gamera
==============================


Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 2.3 and later are supported, though Python 2.4 or later is
  recommended.

  You will need to have the headers (but not the complete source) to
  build Gamera from source code.  Most Linux distributions include
  these as a separate package (eg. ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel``).

- wxPython 2.4.x or later (wxPython 2.8.x or later up to 3.0.x recommended for
  full functionality).

- ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later.

- libtiff 3.5.x or later

- libpng 1.2.x or later

If any of these prerequisites is installed in a non standard directory,
you can use the environment variables ``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` to
pass its locations to the build script, e.g.::

  CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
  LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
  export CFLAGS LDFLAGS


Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
terminal and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

By default, parallelization of the genetic algorithms is only compiled
into Gamera under Linux and with gcc version > 4.2, because we could only
get it running in this environment. If you are sure that you have unbroken
OpenMP support on your system, you can compile Gamera with::

  python setup.py build --openmp=yes

If Gamera is compiled with OpenMP on your system, but OpenMP does not work
on your system for some reason, you can switch it off with::

  python setup.py build --openmp=no


Installing without root privileges
----------------------------------

.. _without_root:

If you do not have root access to your machine, you can make a local
installation of Gamera.

A quick-and-easy way to do this is to use the ``virtual_python.py``
script available here__, and then follow the standard installation
instructions (without using sudo)::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

.. __: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python

Alternatively, you can set up a local installation by hand.

Make a local python module directory somewhere that you have write
privileges (such as your home directory)::

  mkdir ~/python

From the Gamera build directory, install Gamera into that directory::

  python setup.py install --home=~/python

Set up an environment variables so Python can find stuff there (you
may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile file)::

  export PYTHONPATH=~/python/lib/python

Add the local Python scripts directory to your path::

  export PATH=~/python/bin:$PATH

Now you should be able to run the ``gamera_gui`` script from the
command line.

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui`` script, which should have installed to
``/usr/local/bin``.  This file can also be copied anywhere (such as
the Desktop) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of Gamera.

Installing without wxPython
---------------------------

When you need Gamera as a backend for document processing routines on
a server and do not need the GUI, it can save a lot of trouble to
avoid the installation of wxPython. For this case, use the option
``--nowx`` for ``setup.py``::

  python setup.py --nowx build
  sudo python setup.py --nowx install


Mac OS-X
========

On OS-X 10.5 (Panther) up to 10.10 (Yosemite), Gamera compiled oout of the
box with the Apple command line develloper tools and the python and wxpython
that came preinstalled with the OS. Since version 10.11 (El Capatain),
the "system integrity protection" (SIP) prevents installation of third party
packages system wide on OS-X. You must therefore use *virtualenv* on newer
OS-X to create a virtual environments.

Moreover, Gamera currently requires wxPython before 4.0. Versions up to 3.0.x
came installed with OS-X, but are not shipped with OS-X >= 10.11. On
OS-X 10.11 (El Captain) and above, wxPython must therefore be compiled from
the sources.


Installation up to 10.10 (Yosemite)
-----------------------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

Gamera installs out of the box on 10.5 (Leopard) up to 10.10 (Yosemite).
The only prerequisite is to install the comamnd line tools of XCode,
which are avalibale for free from the Apple App Store.


Build and Install
`````````````````

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.
To build Gamera, open a terminal and type::

  # the following line is only required on OS-X 10.6 and later
  export CFLAGS="-stdlib=libstdc++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.6"
  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin privileges)::

  sudo python setup.py install

The script ``gamera_gui`` is installed to ``/usr/local/bin``,
which is also in the default search PATH for programs.


Running
```````

Start the Terminal application and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of
  Gamera.


Installation on 10.11 (El Captain) and above
--------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

Due to the OS-X builtin "system integrity protection" (SIP), wxPython cannot be
installed into the python branch shipped with OS-X. Moreover, you must
install wxPython from the sources, because binary packages are only available
for wxPython 4.x, and Gamera requires an older version of wxPython.

To avoid possible problems with SIP and the python shipped with OS-X,
you can install python from homebrew and also install virtualenv with::

  brew install python2
  pip2 install virtualenv

For the combination Python 2.7 with wxPython 3.0, you must first setup a
virtual environment and activate it, e.g. with::

  virtualenv /usr/local/lib/py2wx3
  source /usr/local/lib/py2wx3/bin/activate

Download the source code of wxPython 3.0.2 from the "Old releases" section
on `wxpython.org`__ and unpack it. There is one fix necessary: in
*src/osx/webview_webkit.mm*, add a cast to *WebBackForwardList* in
lines 936 and 954 as in the following example:

.. code:: CPP

  WebBackForwardList* history = (WebBackForwardList*)[m_webView backForwardList];

.. __: http://wxpython.org/

Then you can compile and install wxPython with the following commands::

  cd root_to_wx_sources/wxPython
  CPPFLAGS=-D__ASSERT_MACROS_DEFINE_VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UNDERSCORES=1
  export CPPFLAGS
  python build-wxpython.py --build_dir=../bld --osx_cocoa --install

This will install wxPython into the virtual environment.


Build and install
`````````````````

You can install Gamera into the same virtual environment with::

  source /usr/local/lib/py2wx3/bin/activate
  cd root_to_gamera_sources
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install


Running
```````

On OS-X, wxPython applications do not run in virtualenvs, because
wxPython requires a "Framework build of python". Fortunately, there is
a simple workaround: store the following shell script as *gamera_gui*
in *$HOME/bin* and modify the PATH variable in $HOME/.profile such, that
*$HOME/bin* is quite at the beginning of the list. Then you can run
*gamera_gui* from the shell, and the script handles the setup of the
virtualenv automatically. (Thanks to `George V. Reilly`__ for proposing
this fix).

Microsoft Windows
=================

Using the binary installer
--------------------------

The binary installers only work with one specific Python version
so you must first make sure that your Python installation matches
this version. The required version is indicated by the filename of
the binary installer, e.g. ``gamera-3.4.1.win-amd64-py2.7.exe`` for
the 64bit version of Python 2.7.

Note that the installer might show an error message in the last screen,
which can be ignored. The installer should create a script file
``Gamera.py`` on the desktop of the installing user, which can be used
to start the Gamera GUI with a double click.

Installing from source
----------------------

Currently, Gamera can be built using the MingW32/GNU toolset or with
the Microsoft SDK. The Python core distribution for Windows officially
only supports the latter option, though it is possible to use MingW,
albeit only the 32bit version of MingW (gcc). The state is currently not
very satisfactory, because MingW is not officially supported by Python
and the Microsoft SDK is not officially supported by Gamera (volunteers
are welcome!).

There are thus three options to compile Gamera on Windows:

- with the `Microsoft SDK`__ (easiest solution)

.. __: #msvc

- with the `standalone Mingw32`__ toolchain

.. __: #mingw32

- or with the MingW32 compiler installed `inside of Cygwin`__

.. __: #cygwin

If you have success with other compilers and configurations,
please consider contributing your experiences to this documentation.

Prerequisites
`````````````

- Python 2.5.x or later
  (only the distribution from python.org has been tested)

- wxPython 2.6.x or later (wxPython 2.8.x or later recommended for
  full functionality)

.. _msvc:

Microsoft SDK
`````````````

For building extensions for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 (both 32 and
64 bit), Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0) is the
compiler that is suitable. You will need the `Microsoft Windows SDK for
Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1`__.

.. __: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=71DEB800-C591-4F97-A900-BEA146E4FAE1&displaylang=en

Note that this lacks some files required by the C99 standard, so you must
additionally download the header files ``stdint.h`` and ``inttypes.h`` from
the `msinttypes project`__ and copy them to the include directory of the
SDK installation.

.. __: https://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/

Assuming that you have installed the 64bit version of Python, you can compile
Gamera with the following commands from the Microsoft SDK shell prompt (the
*color* command is not necessary, but *setenv* can change the colors of the
terminal to an unreadable combination)::

    setenv /x64 /release
    color 0e
    set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
    cd \path\to\gamera-sources
    \path\to\python.exe setup.py bdist_wininst

The installer will be built in the subdirectory ``dist`` and can be started
by double click in the explorer. Note that the installer might display an error
message at the end, depending on the Python distutils version shipped with
your Python installation. This message can simply be ignored.

.. _mingw32:

Standalone Mingw32
``````````````````

Install the Mingw32 port of gcc from http://mingw.org/. Make sure
that you do not only install *gcc-core*, but also *g++* and *make*.
Add the *bin* subdirectory of your Mingw32 installation to
the environment variable ``PATH``.

Assuming you have installed Python to ``C:\Python275``, you can
then compile gamera at a DOS command prompt from the root directory
of the gamera source code with::

  C:\Python27\python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst

This will create a Windows installer, including uninstallation support,
in the *dist* subdirectory. It can be started with a double click
in the Explorer, or from the DOS command prompt with::

  start dist\gamera-*.exe

.. note::

   Fixes for common problems:

    - The Python 2.6 binary from python.org requires ``libmsvcr90.a``,
      which is an erroneous in some versions of Mingw32. To fix it, you can
      recreate the file from the DLL ``msvcr90.dll`` that comes with
      Python 2.6 with pexports__ and *dlltool* (the latter is part of Mingw32)::

        pexports msvcr90.dll > msvcr90.def
        dlltool --input-def msvcr90.def --dllname msvcr90.dll --output-lib libmsvcr90.a -k

      With Python 2.7 and Mingw gcc 4.6, these changes are not necessary.

    - Recent versions of the Mingw gcc no longer support the ``-mno-cygwin``
      option, which is however passed on by the Python distutils. If you run
      into this error, you can simply remove the option from the file::

        C:\Python27\lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py

.. __: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Extension/pexports/


.. _cygwin:

Mingw32 inside Cygwin
`````````````````````

Use the installer from http://www.cygwin.com/ to install Cygwin,
including the ``g++-mingw32`` compiler and the ``MingW32`` libraries.
If you plan to track development of Gamera, you will probably also
want to install ``subversion``.

The important thing to note here is that we are using Cygwin's Mingw32
compiler to build for the standard (non-Cygwin) Python from
python.org.  After a clean install of Cygwin, typing 'python' will
start up Cygwin's version of Python, not the one from python.org.
Therefore, you will want to add the standard Python to your Cygwin
PATH using the command (assuming you installed Python in standard location)::

  export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Python25/:$PATH

Ensure you are using the correct Python by typing::

  which python

The result should be ``/cygdrive/c/Python25/python.exe``, not
``/usr/bin/python``.

Beware that the file ``/usr/bin/gcc`` installed by Cygwin actually
is *not* the compiler executable, but a symbolic link. Symbolic
links are not supported by MS Windows, but are a Cygwin-only
feature. This means that the Python Distutils system cannot execute
``/usr/bin/gcc`` and the build command will fail. To fix this,
replace the symbolic link with the actual compiler executable::

  cp /usr/bin/gcc-3 /usr/bin/gcc
  cp /usr/bin/g++-3 /usr/bin/g++

From here on, you can proceed as for the standalone Mingw32 toolchain,
i.e.::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
  dist/gamera-*.exe
