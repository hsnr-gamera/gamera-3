The tests in this directory test Gamera using the
py.test framework.

The py.test framework must be installed from 

    http://codespeak.net/py/

This package is not required for the proper functioning
of Gamera, only to run the tests. You can run all tests
with

    py.test --tb=no

Alternatively, you can run an individual unit test, say 
test_graph.py, with

    py_test --tb=no test_graph.py

In case of failures you can obtain more information
by omitting the option "--tb=no".
