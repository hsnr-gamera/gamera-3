=====================
Gamera classifier API
=====================

Introduction
------------

For manual training of a classifier, you will generally want to use
the classifier GUI described elsewhere__.  This document describes the
programming API that is used by scripts that make use of a classifier.

.. __: gui.html#interactive-classifier-window

Gamera supports segmentation-based image classification.  This means
that the page image is first segmented into individual connected
components (or glyphs).  Each of these glyphs has a number of features
generated from it.  These features (collectively called a "feature
vector") are then sent to a classifier which, using a database of
training data, identifies the glyph.

Interactive vs. Noniteractive classifiers
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All classifiers in Gamera support the same core Classifier API (interface), so
they are interchangeable.  There is an important
distinction between two families of classifiers, however:

Interactive classifier
  An interactive classifier can have training examples added to it in
  real time, and the results used immediately to classify glyphs.
  Interactive classifiers are useful during the training process since
  the classifier can be "boot strapped" with a few examples and refined
  interactively. 

Noninteractive classifier
  Noninteractive classifiers generally take a complete database of
  training data and then create a highly optimised data structure for
  classification.  Because building that data structure can take a
  considerable amount of time, new training examples can not be added
  on the fly.

Types of classifiers
''''''''''''''''''''

Within each of these families, different classifiers are available.
These "concrete" classifiers have additional methods specific to the
particular classifier type.  The currently implemented classifiers
are:

 - kNNInteractive_
     Interactive *k* nearest neighbor classifier.

 - kNNNonInteractive_
     Noninteractive *k* nearest neighbor classifier.  The weights of
     the dimensions are optimised using a genetic algorithm.


Classifying images without a classifier
---------------------------------------

``id_name``
'''''''''''

When a glyph is classified, either by a manual classification or an
automatic classifier, its classification is stored in the member variable
``id_name``.  This variable is actually a list of possible
classifications, so that I classifier can return a number of different
possibilities with different confidences.  Each classification entry
is a tuple of the form (float *confidence*, string *name*).  The
confidence value is in the range 0.0 - 1.0, where 1.0 is most confident.

For example, if a symbol is most likely a lower-case *b*, but might
also be a lower-case *d*, its ``id_name`` variable might be:

.. code:: Python
  
  [(0.8, 'lower.b'), (0.2, 'lower.d')]

``classification_state``
''''''''''''''''''''''''

How a glyph was classified is managed by the ``classification_state``
member variable.  It can be one of the following values:


  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | Color    | Constant     | Description                                         |
  +==========+==============+=====================================================+
  | |UColor| | UNCLASSIFIED | The connected component is completely unclassified. |
  | (white)  |              |                                                     |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |AColor| | AUTOMATIC    | The connected component was classified by the       | 
  | (red)    |              | automatic classifier using training data.           |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |HColor| | HEURISTIC    | The connected component was classified by some      |
  | (yellow) |              | heuristic (non-exemplar-based) process.             |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |MColor| | MANUAL       | The connected component was classified by a human.  |
  | (green)  |              |                                                     |

Methods
'''''''

Images have a number of methods for managing their classification
state.  Use of these methods is highly recommended over changing the
``id_name`` variable directly.  These methods are documented here__.

.. __: plugins.html#classification

The classifier interface
------------------------

This section describes each method of the classifier interface.
They are divided into three categories:

Core
  Methods available to all classifiers

Interactive
  Methods available only to interactive classifiers

Core
''''

The following methods are available to all classifiers.

Initialization
``````````````

``__init__``
............

**Classifier** (ImageList *database* = ``[]``, *features* = ``'all'``,
bool *perform_splits* = ``True``)

Creates a new classifier instance.

*database*
        Any images in
	the list that were manually classified (have
	classification_state == MANUAL) will be used as training data
        for the classifier.  Any UNCLASSIFIED or AUTOMATICALLY
        classified images will be ignored.

*features*
	A list of feature function names to use for classification.
	These feature names
	correspond to the `feature plugin methods`__.  To use all
	available feature functions, pass in ``'all'``.

.. __: plugins.html#features

*perform_splits*
	  If ``perform_splits`` is ``True``, glyphs trained with names
	  beginning with ``_split.`` are run through a given splitting
	  algorithm.  For instance, glyphs that need to be broken into
	  upper and lower halves for further classification of those
	  parts would be trained as ``_split.splity``.  When the
	  automatic classifier encounters glyphs that most closely
	  match those trained as ``_split``, it will perform the
	  splitting algorithm and then continue to recursively
	  classify its parts.

	  The splitting algorithms are documented `here`__.

.. __: plugins.html#segmentation

          New splitting algorithms can be created by `writing plugin`__ methods
          in the category ``Segmentation``.  

.. __: writing_plugins.html

Classification
``````````````

``classify_glyph_automatic``
............................

**classify_glyph_automatic** (Image *glyph*)

Classifies a glyph and sets its ``classification_state`` and ``id_name``.
(If you don't want the glyph changed, use
guess_glyph_automatic_.)

Returns a 2-tuple (pair) of lists: (*add*, *remove*).  *add* is a list of
glyphs that were created by classifying *glyph* as a split (See
Initialization_).  *remove* is a list of glyphs that are no longer valid due
to reclassifying *glyph* from a split to something else.  Most
often, both of these lists will be empty.  You will normally want to
use these lists to update the collection of glyphs on the current
page.

*glyph*
  The glyph to classify.

``classify_list_automatic``
...........................

**classify_list_automatic** (ImageList *glyphs*, Int *max_recursion* =
``10``)

Classifies a list of glyphs and sets the classification_state and
id_name of each glyph.  (If you don't want it set, use
guess_glyph_automatic_.)

Returns a 2-tuple (pair) of lists: (*add*, *remove*).  *add* is a list of
glyphs that were created by classifying any glyphs as a split (See
Initialization_).  *remove* is a list of glyphs that are no longer valid due
to reclassifying glyphs from a split to something else.  Most
often, both of these lists will be empty.  You will normally want to
use these lists to update the collection of glyphs on the current
page.  If you just want a new list returned with these updates already
made, use classify_and_update_list_automatic_.

*glyphs*
  A list of glyphs to classify.

*max_recursion*
  The maximum level of recursion to follow when splitting glyphs.
  Since some glyphs will split into parts that then classify as
  ``_split`` in turn, a maximum depth should be set to avoid infinite
  recursion.  This number can normally be set quite low, depending on
  the application.

``classify_and_update_list_automatic``
......................................

**classify_and_update_list_automatic** (ImageList *glyphs*, Int
*max_recursion* = ``10``)

A convenience wrapper around classify_list_automatic_ that returns
a list of glyphs with all the splitting updates already made.

``guess_glyph_automatic``
.........................

id_name **guess_glyph_automatic** (Image *glyph*)

Classifies the given *glyph* without setting its classification.  The
return value is of the form described here__.

.. __: #id_name

Grouping
````````

Often, characters do not cleanly correspond to connected components.
For instance, broken or degraded printing may disconnect parts of a
character, or characters, such as *i* may always be made up of two
connected components.  The grouping algorithm is designed to deal with
those cases.  It attempts to group connected components with others
nearby in order to create groupings that are more like glyphs in the
database.  Needless to say, this approach is much slower than the
"one-connected-component-at-a-time" approach, but can produce
considerably better results on certain images.  

The algorithm is described in more detail here__.

.. __: http://dkc.jhu.edu/gamera/papers/droettboom_broken_characters.pdf

``group_list_automatic``
........................

**group_list_automatic** (ImageList *glyphs*, Function
*grouping_function* = ``None``, Function *evaluate_function* = ``None``)

Classifies the given list of glyphs.  Adjacent glyphs are joined
together if doing so results in a higher global confidence.  Each part
of a joined glyph is classified as HEURISTIC with the prefix
``_group``.

*glyphs*
  The list of glyphs to group and classify.

*grouping_function*
  A function (reference) that determines how glyphs are initially
  combined.  This function must take exactly two arguments, which the
  grouping algorithm will pass an arbitrary pair of glyphs from
  *glyphs*.  If the two glyphs should be considered for grouping, the
  function should return ``True``, else ``False``.  

  If no *grouping_function* is provided, a default one will be used.

*evaluate_function*
   A function that evaluates a grouping of glyphs.  This function must
   take exactly one argument which is a list of glyphs.  The function
   should return a confidence value between 0 and 1 (1 being most
   confident) representing how confidently the grouping forms a valid
   character.

   If no *evaluate_function* is provided, a default one will be used.

Saving and loading
``````````````````

These functions deal with saving and loading the training data of the
classifier to/from the `Gamera XML format`__.

Interactive classifiers
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Classification
``````````````

``classify_glyph_manual``
.........................

**classify_glyph_manual** (Image *glyph*, String *id*)

Sets the classification of the given *glyph* to the given *id* and
then adds the glyph to the training data.  Call this function when the
end user definitively knows the identity of the glyph.

*glyph*
	The glyph to classify.

*id*
	The class name.

.. note::
   Here *id* is a simple string, not of the `id_name`_ format, since
   the confidence of a manual classification is always 1.0.

``classify_list_manual``
........................

**classify_list_manual** (ImageList *glyphs*, String *id*)

Sets the classification of the given *glyphs* to the given *id* and
then adds the glyphs to the training data.  Call this function when the
end user definitively knows the identity of the glyphs.

If *id* begins with the special prefix ``_group``, all of the glyphs
in *glyphs* are combined and the result is added to the training
data.  This is useful for characters that always appear with multiple
connnected components, such as the lower-case *i*.

*glyphs*
	The glyphs to classify.

*id*
	The class name.
