Custom data types in plugins
============================

Introduction
============

For common datatypes like *Float* or *PointVector*, the Gamera
C++/Python argument passing interface provides an automatic wrapping
mechanism that is described in `Specifying arguments for plugin
generation and dialog boxes`__.

.. __: args.html

Occasionally, these built in data types are not sufficient, and you
need to pass custom types. A typical situation is that your return
type is a tuple.


An example
==========

Assume we need a plugin *grey_stats* that return both the mean grey value
and its variance on a greyscale image. As the return value is a tuple
of two values, we cannot use one of the built in data types.

We therefore use the generic argument type ``Class`` in the
Python wrapper for our plugin. Note that it is a good idea to
give more information about the actual return value(s) in the
documentation string:

.. code:: Python

  class grey_stats(PluginFunction):
     """Returns mean and variance of the grey values as a tuple *(m,var)*"""
     self_type = ImageType([GREYSCALE])
     return_type = Class("m_var")

On the C++ side, the return type is ``PyObject*`` and can be constructed
with any of the conversion functions from the Python C API, e.g. 
``Py_BuildValue``:

.. code:: C++

  template<class T>
    PyObject* grey_stats(const T &img) {
    size_t i;
    double Ex = 0.0;  // E(X)
    double Ex2 = 0.0; // E(X^2)
    FloatVector* hist = histogram(img);
    for (i=0; i < hist->size(); i++) {
      Ex  += i * (*hist)[i];
      Ex2 += i*i * (*hist)[i];
    }
    delete hist;
    return Py_BuildValue("ff", Ex, Ex2 - Ex*Ex);
  }

In a Python script, the plugin can be called with

.. code:: Python

  (m,v) = img.grey_stats()
  # or:
  m,v = img.grey_stats()

It is also possible to call the plugin from the C++ side, by simply
converting the ``PyObject*`` return value back to C++ data types:

.. code:: C++

  double m,v;
  PyObject* obj;
  obj = grey_stats(img);
  PyArg_ParseTuple(obj, "ff", &m, &v);
  Py_DECREF(obj);

The last line is necessary to avoid a memory leak. The ``Py_BuildValue``
function returns an `"owned reference"`__ (in Python lingo), which means that
it has increased its reference count. To allow the PyObject to be deleted
by the Python runtime library, its reference count must be decreased
again. The actual deletion of the PyObject will then occur at some point
in the future by the Python garbage collector.

Receiving a custom type in C++
==============================

When you have a ``PyObject*`` as an input argument of a plugin function,
you can convert it to C++ data types with the conversion functions from
the `Python C API`__. These are

 * ``PyInt_AsLong`` and colleagues for ordinary scalar data types

 * ``PyArg_ParseTuple`` for tuples

 * ``PyList_GetItem`` for lists

 * ``PyObject_GetAttrString`` for properties of arbitrary classes

.. __: http://docs.python.org/c-api/

A fundamental problem with the conversion from PyObjects is that you
can never be sure what actually is in the ``PyObject*``. For instance,
when you expect a list and apply ``PyList_GetItem``, you cannot be sure
that the ``PyObject*`` actually is a list. Nor can you safely assume that
the list entries are of the data type you belive them to be. It is thus
generally a good idea to check data types with ``PyList_Check`` and 
colleagues, and to throw an exception when the wrong data type enters
your function, e.g.

.. code:: C++

  PyObject* myplugin(PyObject* list) {
    if(!PyList_Check(list))
      throw std::runtime_error("myplugin: Input argument is no list.");
    // ...
  }


Returning a custom type from C++
================================

To return a ``PyObject*`` from a plugin function,
you can use the conversion functions from
the `Python C API`__. These are

 * ``Py_BuildValue`` for tuples or ordinary scalar values;
   as for all common scalar data types the Gamera argument wrapping
   can be used, calling Py_BuildValue for scalar types is usually
   only necessary for creating PyObjects for passing to
   returned lists or custom class properties.

 * ``PyList_New`` and ``PyList_SetItem`` for lists

 * ``PyInstance_New`` and ``PyObject_SetAttrString`` for arbitrary classes

.. __: http://docs.python.org/c-api/

PyObjects returned from a plugin function must always be 
`"owned references"`__. As both ``Py_Build_Value`` and ``PyList_New``
create owned references, this is usually automatically fulfilled.
There is however one special case when you read a list entry from
an input list with ``PyList_GetItem`` and write it to a return list
with ``PyList_SetItem``. As ``PyList_GetItem`` yields a "borrowed
reference", its reference count must be increased if it is to be
returned to Python. Here is an example that returns half of the input
sequence and fills the rest with zeros:

.. __: http://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html#ownership-rules

.. code:: C++

  PyObject* myplugin(PyObject* list) {
    size_t n,i;
    PyObject *retval, *entry;
    n = PyList_Size(list);
    retval = PyList_New(n);
    for (i=0; i<n/2; i++) {
      // PyList_GetItem returns a borrowed reference
      // => reference count must be manually increased (Py_SetItem does not do so)
      entry = PyList_GetItem(list, i);
      Py_INCREF(entry);
      PyList_SetItem(retval, i, entry);
    }
    for (i=n/2; i<n; i++) {
      // Py_BuildValue returns an "owned reference"
      // => no Py_INCREF necessary
      entry = Py_BuildValue("i", 0);
      PyList_SetItem(retval, i, entry);
    }
    return retval;
  }

It is important to note that, unlike ``PyList_SetItem``, ``PyList_Append``
adds a reference to the added item, so that ``Py_INCREF`` must not be
called in this case. In contrast, when you add an already owned reference
to a list with ``PyList_Append``, you must instead decrease its reference
count with ``Py_DECREF``:

.. code:: C++

  PyObject* myplugin(PyObject* list) {
    size_t n,i;
    PyObject *retval, *entry;
    n = PyList_Size(list);
    retval = PyList_New(0);
    for (i=0; i<n/2; i++) {
      // PyList_Append already adds a reference to the added item
      PyList_Append(retval, PyList_GetItem(list, i));
    }
    for (i=n/2; i<n; i++) {
      // Py_BuildValue returns an "owned reference" whose reference count
      // is again increased by PyList_Append => Py_DECREF necessary
      entry = Py_BuildValue("i", 0);
      PyList_Append(retval, entry);
      Py_DECREF(entry);
    }
    return retval;
  }



Implementing a Python class in C++
==================================

Occasionally it can become necessary to write some methods of a custom
Python class in C++. Let us assume, you want to implement the constructor
of a custom class *MyClass* in C++.

The basic idea is to write a plugin function *create_myclass* that returns
an object of type *MyClass* and to call this function in the Python
constructor, i.e. in the ``__init__`` method. This requires a Python
wrapper of the form:

.. code:: Python

  # the class definition
  class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
      mc = _myplugins.create_myclass(arg1, arg2)
      # copy over properties from mc to self
      self.property1 = mc.property1
      self.property2 = mc.property2
      # ...

  # the plugin implementing the actual contructor of MyClass
  class create_myclass(PluginFunction):
    self_type = None
    args = Args([Int("arg1"), Real("arg2")])
    return_type = Class('myclass', MyClass)

The C++ side of the *create_myclass* plugin will then be of the form (this
primitive example simply passes the input arguments unaltered to the
new class as properties, so it is not very useful, but nevertheless a nice
demonstration of the main ideas):

.. code:: C++

  PyObject* create_myclass(int arg1, double arg2) {
    // helper variable for temporary property storage
    PyObject* prop;
    // helper object for creating class instances (see below)
    // declared static so this is initialized only once
    static PyObject* my_class = NULL;

    // create a dictionary and store the properties therein
    // Note that PyDict_SetItemString (unlike PyList_SetItem) INCREFs the passed object
    // => the no longer needed reference returned by Py_BuildValue must be DECREFed
    PyObject* class_dict = PyDict_New();
    prop = Py_BuildValue("i", arg1);
    PyDict_SetItemString(class_dict, "property1", prop);
    Py_DECREF(prop);
    prop = Py_BuildValue("f", arg2);
    PyDict_SetItemString(class_dict, "property2", prop);
    Py_DECREF(prop);

    // create an instance of MyClass from the dictionary
    if (my_class == NULL) {
      my_class = PyClass_New(NULL, PyDict_New(), PyString_FromString("MyClass"));
    }
    return PyInstance_NewRaw(my_class, class_dict);
  }
