Introduction
============

This is the Gamera documentation.  Please note that it is still a work
in progress and has many holes in it.  If you'd like any holes filled
in, please contact Michael Droettboom at ``mdboom at jhu dot edu``.

This documentation consists of some HOW TO documentation and some
reference documentation.  In addition, there are some more formal
published papers available from the `Gamera website`__.
