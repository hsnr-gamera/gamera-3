====================
Gamera graph library
====================

Introduction
------------

Gamera provides a rudimentary framework for dealing with graph
structures.  While this is a clearly Python-centric library, Many of
the algorithms are written in C++ so are generally faster than a pure
Python approach.

This chapter assumes a basic understanding of graph theory and graph
algorithms.   While this document describes the API, it
does not describe in detail how the algorithms work.  (Hopefully this
can be added in a future release of this documentation.)

Examples
--------

Most operations on graphs in the Gamera graph library are methods on
``Graph`` objects.

Each node is identified by an arbitrary Python value.  **Importantly,
the same value may not be assigned to more than one node within the
same graph**.  Whenever a node is needed as an argument, either the
node object or the node's value may be passed in.  In most cases, it
is more convenient to refer to nodes by their associated values rather
than keeping track of their associated ``Node`` objects.

The following example code covers basic usage.  For more detailed
descriptions of the properties and methods, see the Reference_ section.

Let's look at some simple code to create the following trivially small
graph structure:

  .. image:: images/graph_example.png

.. code:: Python

  >>> from gamera import graph
  >>> from gamera import graph_util
  >>>
  >>> g = graph.Graph()
  >>>
  >>> g.add_edge('a', 'b')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('a', 'c')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('a', 'd')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('b', 'd')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('c', 'e')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('f', 'g')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('f', 'g')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('e', 'e')
  1
  >>>

``add_edge`` creates nodes that don't already exist, so ``add_node``
is not necessary to create this graph.

The number of nodes and edges can be queried:

.. code:: Python

  >>> g.nnodes # Number of nodes
  7
  >>> g.nedges # Number of edges
  8

Now, the graph can be traversed, using either a breadth-first search
(BFS) or depth-first search (DFS).  Each search algorithm takes a node
as a starting point:

.. code:: Python

  >>> # node is a Node instance.  Call node() to get its value
  >>> for node in g.BFS('a'):
  ...    print node(),
  ...
  a b c d e
  >>> for node in g.DFS('a'):
  ...    print node(),
  ...
  a d c e b
  >>> # No other nodes reachable from 'e'
  >>> for node in g.BFS('e'):
  ...    print node(),
  ...
  e
  >>> for node in g.BFS('f'):
  ...    print node(),
  ...
  f g

Note that the search algorithms, like many other things in the Gamera
graph library, return lazy iterators, so the results are determined on
demand.  Importantly, this means you can not get the length of the
result until it has been entirely evaluated.

.. code:: Python

  >>> g.BFS('a')
  <gamera.graph.Iterator object at 0xf6fa54d0>
  >>> len(g.BFS('a'))
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  TypeError: len() of unsized object
  >>> list(g.BFS('a'))
  [<Node of 'a'>, <Node of 'b'>, <Node of 'c'>, <Node of 'd'>, <Node of 'e'>]
  >>> [node() for node in g.BFS('a')]
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
  >>>

Note that this graph is composed of two distinct subgraphs.  There are
ways to determine the number of subgraphs and iterate over the roots
of those subgraphs.  For instance, to do a breadth-first search of all
subgraphs:

.. code:: Python

  >>> g.nsubgraphs
  2
  >>> for root in g.get_subgraph_roots():
  ...    for node in g.BFS(root):
  ...       print node.data,
  ...    print
  ...
  a b c d e
  f g

The graph can be restricted based on a number of different
properties by passing flags to the constructor.  These properties
include directedness, cyclicalness, multi-connectedness and
self-connectedness.  (See `Graph constructor`_).

For instance, let's attempt to make a *tree*, which is a graph that
is undirected and contains no cycles, using the same graph structure:

.. code:: Python

  >>> g = graph.Graph(graph.TREE)
  >>> g.add_edge('a', 'b')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('a', 'c')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('a', 'd')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('b', 'd')
  0
  >>> g.add_edge('c', 'e')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('f', 'g')
  1
  >>> g.add_edge('f', 'g')
  0
  >>> g.add_edge('e', 'e')
  0

Note that some edges were not created, since they would have
violated the restrictions of a tree.  This is
indicated by the return value of ``add_edge``.  In this case, our
graph now looks like this:

.. image:: images/graph_example2.png

The reference section below provides a complete list of the algorithms
and methods on graph objects.

edges, is performed through this class.

Node objects
''''''''''''

Nodes contain a reference to an arbitrary Python value.  Importantly,
the value is used to identify the node, so the same value may not be
assigned to more than one node.  In many cases, it is much more convenient to refer
to nodes by their associated values rather than keeping track of
their associated ``Node`` objects.

Properties
``````````

- *data*: 
    The value that identifies this node.  (This value can also
    be obtained by "calling" the node as in ``node()``).

- *edges*: 
    A lazy iterator over the edges pointing out from the node.

- *nodes*: 
    A lazy iterator over the nodes that can be reached directly
    (through a single edge) from this node.

- *nedges*:
    The number of edges going out from this node.

Edge objects
''''''''''''

Methods
```````

traverse
""""""""

**traverse** (*node*)

Returns the node on the other end of the edge.  (Useful only for
undirected graphs).

Properties
``````````

- *from_node*:
    The starting node of this edge.

- *to_node*:
    The ending node of this edge.

- *cost*:
    The cost associated with traversing this edge (used by algorithms
    such as create_minimum_spanning_tree_).

- *label*:
    The label associated with this edge.

Implementation details
----------------------

There are many ways to represent graphs in memory for different
applications.  Unfortunately, this library only uses one, which may
not be suitable for all applications.  It is as follows:

  - The graph object contains arrays of all nodes and edges.
    Therefore, random access to nodes and edges is constant time (*O*(1)).
    Deleting nodes and edges is in linear time (*O*(*n*)).
    
  - The graph contains a hash table from node data to nodes, so given a
    particular piece of data associated with a node, the node can be
    looked up in *O*(*n* ln *n*) time.

  - Each node contains an array of coincident edges.  If the graph is
    directed, this includes edges going in and out from the node.
