Changes made between Gamera File Releases
=========================================

 - option --nowx for setup.py to install without wxPython


Version 3.4.0, Nov 20, 2012
----------------------------

 - GA optimization module rewritten from scratch
     o evolutionary optimization now for selection and weighting implemented
     o replacement of used library (GALib was replaced by EO)
     o optimization process is now highly configurable
     o fitness evaluation is now parallelizable
   (thanks to Tobias Bolten)

 - knncoremodule splitted in header and implementation file

 - feature normalization for noninteractive classifier now works

 - feature selection supported as a better alternative to feature weighting

 - components of individual features can be switsched on or off with
   knn.kNN[Non]Interactive.set_selections_by_feature[s]

 - Point-types can be added

 - new plugins brink_threshold and diagonal_projections (feature)
   (thanks to Andrew Hankinson)

 - new C++ operators in dimension type Point:
   o addition with operator+
   o comparison with operator<
     (this makes no reals sense, but allows Points to be keys in maps)

 - convex_hull could return doublets in the point list


Version 3.3.3, May 15, 2012
----------------------------

 - new plugins min_max_location() and max_empty_rect()

 - Rect can now be a return type of a plugin function

 - ImageType arguments can be optional with "default=NoneDefault"

 - C++ graph API also usable from toolkits

 - fixed a type mismatch in graph API on 64bit bigendian architectures

 - changing feature set in Biollante now works

 - changes in rank() and mean():
    o significantly faster
    o default border_treatment changed to 'reflect',
      because that leads to more expected results than 'padwhite'
    o extended to grey16 images

 - min_max_filter for computing minimum and maximum filter in
   a runtime that is independent from the window size (thanks to
   David Kolanus). This method is now used by shading_subtraction
   to speed up the binarization considerably.

 - convex_hull did not work in some cases

 - option "--version" added to gamera_gui


Version 3.3.2, Sep 19, 2011
----------------------------

 - FSF address in all files corrected

 - sub_cc_analysis did not work on images with offset

 - fixed memory leaks in segmentation_error


Version 3.3.1, Aug 25, 2011
----------------------------

 - plugins for convex hull computation added in category Geometry

 - Int args can now have default NoneDefault;
   required use of TextControl instead of SpinControl for Int in GUI

 - new binarization plugin shading_subtraction for images
   with shaded backgrounds

 - conversion from FLOAT to GREYSCALE/GREY16/RGB now works when
   FLOAT image contains negative values. The range [min,max] is
   now linearly scaled to grey range.

 - runlength_smearing no longer returns empty segments

 - RGBPixel.value now returns V in [0.0,1.0] as documented, not in [0,255]


Version 3.3.0, Mai 02, 2011
----------------------------

 - graph API completely rewritten from scratch (thanks to Christian Brandt)
   Changes from a user's perspective:
    o colorize() for coloring a (planar) graph in linear time
    o new flag CHECK_ON_INSERT
    o is_*_connected now actually tests connectedness
    o is_cyclic now actually tests for cycles
    o has_path() for path existence check between nodes
    o add_edge no longer crashes after edges had been removed
    o now also usable directly from C++ (see documentation)

 - geostructs/colorgraph.* have been removed (now available in graph API)

 - rubber band selection in image display improved

 - image_copy() did not work for 1x1 images

 - new plugin contour_pavlidis (category Analysis/Contour)


Version 3.2.7, Mar 11, 2011
----------------------------

 - _group._part glyphs no longer saved in classifier training data:
   when saved as "Page glyphs", they are still saved, but no longer
   when saved as "Classifier glyphs"

 - interactive view selection with rubber bands now also works
   when rubber band touches the image border

 - toolkits now compile out-of-the box again on Ubuntu

 - the following classifier menu entries now work:
    o "Image/Save glyphs into separate files"
    o "File/Symbol names/Import"

 - new plugin segmentation_error (category "PageSegmentation")

 - ProgressFactory now has optional constructor argument
   "numsteps" for doing the update only in *numsteps* discrete steps
   (used for significantly speeding up loading/saving XML files)

 - group_[and_update]_list_automatic() now has an optional
   argument "criterion" for chosing the way how the best
   grouping is chosen. The old method was "avg", while the new
   default is "min", because we have found this to be better in our tests.


Version 3.2.6, Jun 08, 2010
----------------------------

 - plugin args Class, ImageList, and Pixel now support
   default value NoneDefault

 - new plugin graph_color_ccs (category "Color")

 - new plugin contour_samplepoints (category "Analysis/Contour")

 - new plugin delaunay_from_points (category "Geometry")
   for Delaunay triangulation

   and an optional border treatment (clip or reflect)

 - runlength_smearing and projection_cutting now also work
   on views with non zero offset

 - computation of some features corrected:
    o nholes (white rows/cols made whole count negative)
    o nholes_extended (normalization for scale invariance was missing)
    o compactness (border pixels were formerly ignored in computation)
    o skeleton_features (crossings through x/y-axis was erronously computed)
    o volume[16|64]regions (zones occasionally not covered entire images)
    o moments (no longer overflow errors on larger glyphs)
    o Zernike moments now have the desired invariance properties

 - new Python image methods white() and black() for obtaining
   these colors in the pixel type representation of the image

 - should now also compile on MacOS X 10.6 out-of-the-box

 - changes for 64bit architecture:
    o default range of Int, Real, Point made smaller than sys.maxint
    o writing TIFFs corrected

 - necessary changes for libpng 1.4.0 with #if's on PNG_LIBPNG_VER


Version 3.2.4, Feb 12, 2010
----------------------------

 - new deformation plugins degrade_kanungo and white_speckles

 - new plugins colors_to_labels (category "Color") and
   ccs_from_labeled_image (category "Utility") for reading
   manually labeled ground truth data (thanks to Hasan Yilidz)

 - corrected border treatment in neighbor.hpp (affected mean
   and rank) and fixed another error in the rank filter

 - plugin category cleanup:
    o "Convolution" moved to "Filter"
    o new category "Thinning"

   see the bottom of doc/src/index.txt for details

 - newer VIGRA version 1.6 included with some backports
   (see the file include/vigra/README for a list of modifications)

 - warnings about unavailable optional packages only printed
   when config.set("verbosity_level",1) has been set


Version 3.2.2, Oct 01, 2009
----------------------------

 - plugin loading message no longer printed in non-GUI scripts;
   in case these messages are needed, they can optionally be 
   enabled by config.set("verbosity_level",1)

 - bugfix in graph API: node values are now compared by value,
   not by PyObject pointer => nodes with labels greater than 256
   are now reliably found

    o new method set_distance for dimension weighting
    o k_nearest_neighbors now supports an optional search predicate

 - classifier display can be closed and opened again

 - corrected slider display in Biollante

 - corrected resize function in VIGRA

 - the knn classifier can now return different confidence
   measures for the main id that are selectable by the
   user. See the classifier API documentation for details.

 - knn classifier now works as expected when k > 1;
   up to now, id_name was sorted by confidence, which meant
   that always the farthest among the k nearest neighbors
   was returned as main_id

 - now compiles with Python 2.6 (thanks to Prapat Suriyaphol)
