Gamera kd-tree library
======================

Introduction
------------

A *kd-tree* is multidimensional generalization of a binary
search tree. It can be used efficiently for range queries and nearest
neighbor searches, provided the dimension is not to high. In document
analysis problems, the dimension is typically two, so that kd-trees
can be a powerful utility for layout analysis problems.

A detailed introduction to kd-trees can be found in the literature:

- for an introduction to kd-trees and basic properties, see [deBerg2000]_
- more algorithms for kd-trees can be found in the original article 
  [Bentley1975]_
- none of the above references covers nearest neighbor
  searches in kd-trees; these are coverd in [Friedman1977]_


Examples
--------

Here is an example for looking up the three nearest neighbors to
a given point from a set of sample points:

.. code:: Python

   from gamera.kdtree import *

   points = [(1,4), (2,4), (1,5), (3,6), (8,9),
             (2,7), (4,4), (5,5), (4,6), (8,3)]
   nodes = [KdNode(p) for p in points]
   tree = KdTree(nodes)

   # neighbors to a sample point not from the set
   point = [5,6]
   k = 3
   knn = tree.k_nearest_neighbors(point, k)
   print "%i neighbors of (%i,%i):" % (k,point[0], point[1]),
   for node in knn:
       print "(%i,%i)" % (node.point[0], node.point[1]),
   print "" # final newline

   # neighbors to a sample point from the set
   # we must query k+1 neighbors, because one of them is
   # the sample point (the first entry in the returned list)
   point = [5,5]
   k = 3
   knn = tree.k_nearest_neighbors(point, k+1)
   print "%i neighbors of (%i,%i):" % (k,point[0], point[1]),
   for node in knn[1:]:
       print "(%i,%i)" % (node.point[0], node.point[1]),
   print "" # final newline

The property *KdNode.data* can store an arbitrary Python object
associated with the point. The following example represents each
connected component by its middle point and stores the actual
CC with the point in the node:

.. code:: Python

   ccs = image.cc_analysis()
   nodes = [KdNode(cc.center, cc) for cc in ccs]


The Kd-Tree Python API
----------------------


``KdNode`` objects
''''''''''''''''''

Each ``KdNode`` has two properties:

 *point*
   The geometric location of the node as a sequence of coordinate
   numbers. The coordinate numbers can be floats or ints.
   This is an immutable property, because changing the geometric
   location of nodes belonging to an already built kd-tree obviously
   breaks subsequent search operations.

 *data*
   An arbitrary Python object connected to the location *point*.

.. docstring:: gamera.kdtree KdNode

``KdTree`` objects
''''''''''''''''''

Each kd-tree is represented by instances of the ``KdTree`` class.
Even though there are general kd-tree algorithms to add and remove
nodes dynamically (see [Bentley1975]_), the present implementation
does not support alteration of a once built tree. This has the
consequence that tree nodes must be passed to the contructor of
``KdTree``.

A ``KdTree`` has the following (read only) properties:

 *dimension*
   The dimension of the kd-tree. This is automatically determined
   by the constructor.

.. docstring:: gamera.kdtree KdTree

.. docstring:: gamera.kdtree KdTree set_distance

.. docstring:: gamera.kdtree KdTree k_nearest_neighbors


The Kd-Tree C++ API
-------------------

The module ``gamera.kdtree`` is only a thin Python wrapper around
a C++ class ``kdtree``. This can also be used directly in C++ plugins.

Compilation and linkage
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The header file *kdtree.hpp* declares the necessary structures in
the namespace ``Gamera::Kdtree``. It is installed with the other gamera
header files, and can thus be included with

.. code:: CPP

   #include "kdtree.hpp"
   using namespace Gamera::Kdtree;

The tricky part is getting your plugin module to be linked with the
actual kdtree implementation. There are two ways, depending whether
you are working on the gamera core code or on a separate toolkit.

In the gamera core code, you can simply add the file ``kdtree.cpp``
to the ``cpp_sources`` property in the plugin Python interface:

.. code:: Python

   class ExampleModule(PluginModule):
       category = "MyPlugins"
       cpp_headers=["myplugins.hpp"]
       cpp_sources=["src/kdtree.cpp"]
       functions = [myplugin1, myplugin2]
   module = ExampleModule()

In a toolkit, you can theoretically specify the absolute path to the location
of *kdtree.cpp* in ``cpp_cources``, but this would not be portable because
it depends on the path of your local copy of the gamera source code. In
this case, it is therefore better to include copies of the files 
*kdtree.hpp* and *kdtree.cpp* from the gamera sources in your toolkit
and set ``cpp_sources`` to the relative path in your toolkit.


Usage
'''''

For normal use of the kdtree, you will need the classes 
``CoordPoint`` (a typedef for ``vector<double>``), ``KdNode``, 
``KdNodeVector``, and ``KdTree``. Beside the property ``point``, a
``KdNode`` can also store an arbitrary pointer as ``data``. See
the header file *kdtree.hpp* for details.

Here is a usage example for a nearest neighbor search:

.. code:: CPP

   // set points for building the tree
   KdNodeVector nodes;
   double points[][2] = {
     {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,5}, {3,6}, {8,9},
     {2,7}, {4,4}, {5,5}, {4,6}, {8,3},
     {-20,-20} // array terminator
   };
   size_t i;
   for (i=0; points[i][0]>=-1.0; i++) {
     CoordPoint p;
     p.push_back(points[i][0]);
     p.push_back(points[i][1]);
     nodes.push_back(KdNode(p));
   }

   // build the tree
   KdTree tree(&nodes);

   // find the three nearest neighbors to (5,6)
   KdNodeVector neighbors;
   CoordPoint point(2);
   point[0] = 5;
   point[1] = 6;
   tree.k_nearest_neighbors(point, 3, &neighbors);
