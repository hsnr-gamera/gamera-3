ToDo list for Gamera
====================

 - Replace the deprecated Numeric/Numarray with NumPy.
 - More documentation of wrapped Vigra functions
 - More page layout analysis resp. page segmentation methods.
   E.g. text/graphics separation and more text line finding
   algorithms. Maybe some parts of Leptonica could be useful?
 - Add some preprocessing operations like kfill or other local
   thresholding methods and multilevel thresholding.
 - Feature selection via genetic algorithms (GA) as an alternative
   to the currently implemented GA based feature weighting.
 - A new menu function in the interactive classifier dialog for
   highlighting outliers, i.e. possible manual misclassifications.
   Can be based on MNN editing.
 - Add automatic clustering algorithms for training data.
 - Adding more classifiers like Gaussian mixture models, support
   vector machines, or hidden Markov models.
 - Add support for the hOCR exchange format in the form of a general
   writing and parsing library.
 - Write a toolkit for standard text document recognition, i.e. a
   more complete version of roman.py.
 - Write wrappers for external OCR engines like Tesseract OCR as
   optional plugins.
 - Add more image formats: JPEG (reading/writing), PDF (writing),
   NIST special database 19 (reading)...
